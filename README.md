# PredictionsOnTaskPerformance

Repository for the Applied Cognitive Science Project at TU Darmstadt WS2019/2020

## TODOs

1. Read in hand-drawn distribution (curves)
2. Transform read curves into probability distributions
3. Discretize probability distributions
4. Compare user-given distributions about the scores with actual achieved scores on tasks
5. Normalize discrete probability distributions
6. Framework for modular use
7. Design Check boxes and implement algorithm for reading
8. Design prediction of performance at end of questionnaire
9. Include an open guess question: e.g. size of cities in Europe.


## Questions:

1. Are 10 items to much? Humans can only hold 7 Â± 2 items in short term memory.
2. Maybe 10 instead of 5 questions (to compensate)?
3. Exchange social media question?
