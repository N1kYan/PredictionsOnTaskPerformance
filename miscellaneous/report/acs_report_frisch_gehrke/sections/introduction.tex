	\item Measuring metacognition is important because .. ?
	\item Metacognitive sensitivity ?
	\item Metacognitive bias?
	\item Metacognitive efficiency?
	\item Useful starting point for all measures of metacognitive sensitivity: 2x2 confidence-accuracy table ("type 2" SDT table)
	\item Simplest measure of association between rows and columns of the table is the phi$(\phi)$ correlation.
	\item $G$: Goodman-Kruskall gamma coefficient
	\item Both are affected by metacognitive bias
	\item Standard way to remove influence of bias: Apply STD ($d'$)
	\item $d'$ will be constant given different biases
	\item Several approaches to metacognitive sensitivity
	\item But type 2 $d'$ is also affected by changes in metacognitive bias
	\item One solution: Apply non-parametric analysis that does not make equal-variance gaussian assumptions (e.g. use ROC analysis)
	\item Can be applied to type 2 data.
	\item Further complication: $\phi$, $G$, $d'$ and type 2 ROC are affected by the task performance.
