# Final Project: 9.12.19 (Seminar) - 16.03.20 (13:00 hrs)

Vote for your project: https://doodle.com/poll/53z7br6purufek7p

The final examination is a project in which, in addition to the code created, a report must also be submitted. Describe the algorithms and platforms you used and discuss challenges that you faced during implementation. The presentation of the topics and the grouping will be take place on 9th December (lecture & seminar).

You submit your code as a whole project, the requirements will follow later. Either send the project zipped or create a private Github repository to which you invite us (in this case, notify us by mail).
Send the project report to us by e-mail and submit a printed version in addition (does not require expensive binding or glossy paper).

## Important hint:

Clearly identify which team member has done which job. This means that you comment on corresponding code passages with your name.

Each team member writes exactly two sections in the report! Mark them with your name as well.

### Code:
* For your code please follow PEP 8 Style Guide: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
* There should be a dependency list and an easy installation using pip, starting from an empty environment, should be possible.
* Every directory should contain a Readme file and there should be examples showing how to run your code.

### Report:
The paper should contain the following parts:

* introduction: motivation, task and references to related work
* methods: describe your ideas and your realization of the task
* results: test your code on data and describe the results
* discussion: discuss challenges that you faced during implementation, reflect your solution and give an outlook.

The final presentations of the projects are expected to take place on 17.03.20.
